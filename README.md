# DeKRR-DDRF
This is the MATLAB code corresponding to the paper: 

R. Yang, F. He, M. He, J. Yang and X. Huang, "Decentralized Kernel Ridge Regression Based on Data-Dependent Random Feature," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3414325, URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596673, which uses “for loop” to simulate the parallel computing.

In each "Fig/", "RunMain.m" is the main program. 

The results of our experiments are detailed in "Fig/Results/" folders.
